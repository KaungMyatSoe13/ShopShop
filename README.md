# ShopShop 🛒

An **E-Commerce Web Application(Responsive!!)** built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** and **Cloudinary** for image storage.  
This project is inspired by [Minusx Clothing](https://minusxclothing.com) and is designed to support local brands.

Currently, orders can only be made using **Cash on Delivery (COD)**.  
The application includes both a **User Dashboard** and an **Admin Dashboard**.
